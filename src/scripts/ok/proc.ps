%% So immediately before the execution of 'repeat' you would have two objects on the

%% You don't look up the name until the executable array containing the name is executed.

/test {(This is my initial string\n) print} def

2 {test} repeat

2 {test} 

% Notice that I've redefined 'test' after creating the executable array containing the

% As you can see, its vitally important not to do name lookup too early!

/test {(This is my second string\n) print} def
